# Running a realbook

In order to run a realbook, you must do four things.  It's probably a good
idea to wrap all of these steps in a single Task, and place that task
in a supervision tree.

1. Specify the realbook directory.  This is global, and can be set at
  compile time using the `Config.config/2` directive in your `config.exs`
  or child configuration files.
  ```elixir
  Application.put_env(:realbook, :script_dir, realbook_script_dir)
  ```
  If you're going to release your app to prod, it's recommended to
  keep these scripts in the `priv` directory.

2. Connect to the target.  The following example shows how to connect
  with passwordless ssh.  For other options, see `SSH.connect/2`:
  ```elixir
  Realbook.connect!(:ssh, host: "my_host", user: "admin")
  ```
  Note that the `:local` connect target is also provided.


3. Set required variables.  If you forget any, the realbook won't execute.
  ```elixir
  Realbook.set(foo: "bar", baz: "quux")
  ```

4.  Launch the realbook.
  ```elixir
  Realbook.exec("my_realbook_script.exs")
  ```
